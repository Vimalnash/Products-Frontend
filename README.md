# Project

// * Functional Requirement :

// 1. Use https://dummyjson.com/docs to find JSON contract for fetching products and product categories.
  // https://dummyjson.com/products shows product

// 2. Display all categories and make it selectable (single-select).

// 3. Show products for the selected category otherwise show products from all categories when no category selected.

// 1. While fetching products use pagination parameter and keep size 10.

// (If given combination has 50 products we need to show all products in the single page without UI pagination but instead of fetching all products at once we have to fetch the data in batches i.e first 1-10 then 11 - 20.. so on and display whichever is fetched till now)

// 4. Implement Search for the products.

// 5. List down if there are any limitations of your app as comments in “App.js”.
